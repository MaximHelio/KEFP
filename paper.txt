CONSPECTUS: When molecular vibrational modes strongly couple to
virtual states of photonic modes, new molecular vibrational polariton
states are formed, along with a large population of dark reservoir
modes. The polaritons are much like the bonding and antibonding
molecular orbitals when atomic orbitals form molecular bonds, while
the dark modes are like nonbonding orbitals. Because the polariton
states are half-matter and half-light, whose energy is shifted from the
parental states, polaritons are predicted to modify chemistry under
thermally activated conditions, leading to an exciting and emerging field
known as polariton chemistry that could potentially shift paradigms in
chemistry. Despite several published results supporting this concept,
the chemical physics and mechanism of polariton chemistry remain
elusive. One reason for this challenge is that previous works cannot
differentiate polaritons from dark modes. This limitation makes delineating the contributions to chemistry from polaritons and dark
states difficult. However, this level of insight is critical for developing a solid mechanism for polariton chemistry to design and predict
the outcome of strong coupling with any given reaction. My group addressed the challenge of differentiating the dynamics of
polaritons and dark modes by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. Specifically, (1) we found that polaritons can
facilitate intra- and intermolecular vibrational energy transfer, opening a pathway to control vibrational energy flow in liquid-phase
molecular systems, and (2) by studying a single-step isomerization event, we verified that indeed polaritons can modify chemical
dynamics under strong coupling conditions, but in contrast, the dark modes behave like uncoupled molecules and do not change the
dynamics. This finding confirmed the central concept of polariton chemistry: polaritons modify the potential energy landscape of
reactions. The result also clarified the role of dark modes, which lays a critical foundation for designing cavities for future polariton
chemistry. Aside from using 2D IR spectroscopy to study polariton chemistry, we also used the same technique to develop molecular
polaritons into a potential quantum simulation platform. We demonstrated that polaritons have Rabi oscillations, and using a
checkerboard cavity design, we showed that polaritons could have large nonlinearity across space. We further used the checkerboard
polaritons to simulate coherence transfer and visualize it. A unidirectional coherence transfer was observed, indicating non-
Hermitian dynamics. The highlighted efforts in this Account provide a solid understanding of the capability of polaritons for
chemistry and quantum information science. I conclude this Account by discussing a few challenges for moving polariton chemistry
toward being predictable and making the polariton quantum platform a complement to existing systems.

■ MOTIVATIONS AND BACKGROUND
When molecular modes strongly couple to photonic cavity
modes, such that the molecules exchange energy with photons at
higher rates than their corresponding dissipation, the light−
matter interactions are in the strong coupling regime, forming
so-called polaritons.5−7 While it is an established concept in
quantum electrodynamics, the polariton concept has recently
caught the attention of chemistry. Ebbesen pioneered this
concept that when molecular vibrational modes are strongly
coupled with the cavity modes and form molecular vibrational
polaritons (MVPs), they can modify chemistry8−10 because the
polaritons have different energy levels and wave functions from
the composing vibrational modes. This novel concept of
modifying chemical events by vibrational strong coupling
(VSC) was supported by several research results using multiple
techniques, including IR, UV−vis, and mass spectrometry,11−14
which have led to an exciting emerging new field termed
polariton chemistry.
Given the great promise of polariton chemistry, it is necessary
to have a clear mechanism of polariton chemistry that allows
predictions of whether VSC can influence a given reaction and
eventually leads to rational designs of photonic cavities to
catalyze specific reactions.15,16 The understanding of polariton
chemistry is still not fully developed, partly because it is new and
partly because of a fundamental gap between experiment and
theory, which I explain below. Because the dipolar interactions
between a single molecule and the cavity mode (g0) are often not
strong enough, it requires an ensemble of N molecules to
interact with the cavity mode and reach VSC collectively. The
collective coupling strength is proportional to g N 0 , and it
requires N ≈ 1010 to reach the so-called collective VSC regime.
The consequence of the collective VSC is that there are also N −
1 dark modes that have no photonic components in their wave
functions10,16−19 and resemble localized (or semilocalized20−23)
molecular modes (Figure 1A). Thus, dark modes are not
expected to influence chemical processes. Because the N − 1
dark modes significantly outnumber the two polariton modes,
chemical reactions should be dictated by dark modes, thereby
leading to little changes to reactions. Indeed, several theoretical
works on the collective VSC regime did observe little changes to
chemical reactions,24−30 and a couple of experimental works
reported null results.31,32 On the other hand, theoretical works
on the single-molecule VSC regime,33−36 i.e., making a single
molecule strongly coupled to the cavity modes, provided
unambiguous evidence to support that polaritons can modify
reactions (and there were no dark modes in this case), agreeing
with some experiments in the collective VSC regime.11−14 Given
the myriad of evidence supporting polariton chemistry in the
collective coupling regime (despite a few reports on issues of
reproducibility31,32) and the unavoidable influence of dominating
dark modes from the theory perspective, it is critical to
answer the question of how the interplays between polaritons
and dark modes can lead to polariton chemistry. Pertinent
questions include the following: What can polaritons do? Can
dark modes change chemistry? How does VSC influence the
vibrational energy dynamics to affect reactions? This challenge
emphasizes the importance of differentiating polaritons from
dark modes and following their dynamics to understand the
roles of polaritons and dark modes in modifying chemistry. In
this Account, I will discuss ultrafast polariton dynamic research
from my group and highlight what we have learned about the
capabilities of polaritons (Figure 1B) and conclude with an
outlook of remaining challenges (Figure 1C). ■ 2D IR SPECTROSCOPY FOR VIBRATIONAL
POLARITONS
Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy,37−48 a
coherent multidimensional ultrafast nonlinear optical technique,
is well-suited for differentiating polaritons and dark reservoir
modes. After the first report of the ultrafast IR pump−probe
study of MVPs by Dunkelberger, Owrutsky, and co-workers49
and inspired by theoretical works,50 our group collaborated with
the Naval Research Laboratory group to implement 2D IR
spectroscopy to study polariton dynamics.1,51 We showed that
2D IR spectroscopy has unique capabilities to resolve dark
modes from polariton states. This method has since been
adopted to study pure polaritonic responses and polaritons in
open cavity systems.52−54

2D IR spectroscopy uses a three-pulse pulse sequence to
probe the evolution of molecular vibrational energy in the
system (Figure 2A). The first pulse prepares the system into a
vibrational coherence state that is converted to either a
population or coherence state by the second pulse. After waiting
for a certain time delay (t2), the third pulse (probe) relaunches
the vibrational coherences, emitting an IR signal. The IR signal is
heterodyned by a local oscillator pulse (often the same third
pulse), dispersed by a spectrograph, and detected by a mercury−
cadmium−telluride array detector. The measured IR spectrum
(whose axis is noted as ωprobe or ω3) encodes the latter
coherence dynamics along t3 after the third IR pulse interaction.
We scan the time delay between the first and second IR pulses
(t1) and record the corresponding pump−probe spectrum to
characterize the first vibrational coherence dynamics. The t1
series pump−probe dynamics is Fourier transformed into a
spectrum along ωpump or ω1. Thus, the correlation between
ωpump and ωprobe can be plotted as a 2D map, known as a 2D IR
spectrum. One advantage of 2D IR spectroscopy versus a
pump−probe experiment is that molecular resonances are
distinguished along ωpump. Thus, it can differentiate the initial
quantum states and follow their evolutions by scanning the delay
time t2.
We showed that 2D IR spectroscopy has an advantage of
differentiate various quantum states on polariton systems
(Figure 2B). Below, I use the polaritons created by the
asymmetric vibrational modes of W(CO)6 under VSC as an
example. The 2D IR spectrum showed two clear peaks along the
diagonal, representing the UP and LP resonances, and crosspeaks
indicating the polaritons interacting with each other
(Figure 2C,D, bottom). However, the more striking feature
(gray boxes) is that there are peaks at ω1 = ωdark, suggesting that
the dark modes are also excited and interacting with polaritons.1
The dark modes are visible because of the chemical
inhomogeneity, as theory predicted.55 Nevertheless, the fact
that the 2D IR spectrum has distinct polariton and dark mode
features along ω1 gives it a unique strength to address the
existing challenges in polariton chemistry.
The 2D IR dynamics of MVPs differ from a pure molecular
system, as the polaritons are hybrids between molecules and
photons. When t2 is shorter than the lifetime of polaritons
(tpolariton), the polariton populations and their coherent nonlinear
interactions dominate, leading to the 2D IR and pump−
probe peaks with pure absorptive line shape (Figure 2C).51 We
have attributed the nonlinearity to nonlinear dephasing, and
further theoretical studies are necessary for this mechanism.
However, the mechanism is well-understood when t2 is longer
than the lifetime of the polaritons. In this time regime, polaritons
decay into the dark reservoir modes. Thus, the dark reservoir
modes are excited from the ground state, effectively reducing the
population of molecules to couple to the cavity modes, further
decreasing the collective coupling strength and, thereby, the
Rabi splitting. As a result, the UP peak frequency shifts down and
the LP peak frequency shifts up, leading to derivative features in
the 2D IR spectrum. The derivative features are difficult to
resolve in the ω3 = ωLP region because they are overwhelmed by
the large absorptive feature from the v = 1 →2 transition of the
dark reservoir modes due to its anharmonicity (Figure
2D).1,18,49,56 Overall, the early-time coherent dynamics of
polariton states (t2 < tpolariton) can be useful for potential
quantum applications. In contrast, the dynamics in the late-time
regime (t2 > tpolariton) corresponds to the incoherent population

used a pump−probe geometry where the first two pulses are collinear and compose the pump beam and the third pulse acts as the probe beam and the

short t2 time delay, the pump−probe spectrum shows absorptive features due to polaritonic nonlinear interactions. (bottom) The 2D IR spectrum
shows similar absorptive features but clearly shows cross-peaks (at the antidiagonal corner of the dashed box), indicating polariton−polariton
interactions. (D) (top) At a long t2 time delay, the pump−probe spectrum evolves to a derivative shape at ω3= ωUP because of Rabi splitting
contraction and an absorptive feature at ω3= ωLP due to the strong 1 → 2 transitions of dark reservoir modes. (bottom) The corresponding 2D IR
spectrum shows similar features. It is noticeable that there are peaks of dark modes at ω1 = ωdark in the 2D IR spectra (gray boxes in the bottom spectra
of C and D). Thus, 2D IR spectroscopy can differentiate polaritons and dark modes. (B) and (D) are adapted with permission from ref 1. Copyright

dynamics of molecules that participated in polariton formation.
This incoherent dynamics reveals how the excited polariton
energy is deposited into pure molecular vibrational modes.
Because this deposited energy can stay in molecular modes for
hundreds of picoseconds, this process could thereby influence
chemical reactions. Below, I will mostly focus on the late-time
incoherent dynamics related to polariton chemistry and then use
one section to discuss our efforts to develop MVPs into a
potential quantum simulation platform.
■ MVP-MEDIATED VIBRATIONAL ENERGY
TRANSFER
The photonic component of polaritons grants them delocalization.
As a result, it has been shown in the exciton−polariton
regime that excitonic energy can be delocalized among spatially
separated films.57,58 It is natural to consider whether such a
polariton-mediated energy transfer could happen to vibrational
degrees of freedom. Compared to excitons, the dipole strengths
of vibrational modes are much smaller, which makes the dipole−
dipole coupling-mediated energy transfer negligible (with the
exceptions of a few special systems59,60) (Figure 3A). The lack of
intermolecular vibrational energy transfer (VET) is evidenced
by the absence of cross-peaks in the 2D IR spectrum of the
W(CO)6 and W(13CO)6 mixtures outside the cavity (dashed
box area in Figure 3B). However, controlling VET is critical in
manipulating the vibrational energy flow for chemical transformation61
and transducing signals among biological entities.62
Thus, it would be an important advance if energy transfer among
specific vibrational modes could be turned on through
engineering of VSC (Figure 3C), which would enable many
new applications.
To realize it, we tuned the cavity so that its resonance is
between the asymmetric vibrational modes of W(CO)6 and
W(13CO)6, leading to a three-polariton system.2,63−65 We
ensured that the coupling strength was high enough that the UP,
MP, and LP were composed of the two vibrational modes and
the single cavity mode, as indicated by their Hopfield
coefficients. Noticeably, the UP was primarily composed of
W(CO)6 and the cavity mode, with a small contribution from
W(13CO)6 (Figure 3D). The molecular compositions of LP
were flipped compared to UP.
In the 2D IR spectrum, at long t2, such as t2 = 30 ps, a clear
cross-peak appeared at ω1 = ωUP, ω3 = ωLP (orange box in Figure
3E). Because the data were taken long after the polariton relaxed
to the dark reservoir modes, this cross-peak indicated that when
UP was excited, its energy could be transferred to the first
excited state of W(13CO)6, whose v = 1 → 2 transition was
resonant with LP transitions. The excited population of
W(13CO)6 was 6 times more than expected if the cross-peak
was solely due to the W(13CO)6 compositions in the wave
functions of UP. Thus, this result indicated that VSC enabled a
significant energy transfer from W(CO)6 to W(13CO)6.
Furthermore, the efficiency of VET could be enhanced by
increasing the cavity thickness, which intuitively was because the
long cavity allowed more cavity (and polariton) lifetime to
mediate energy transfer. This intermolecular VET occurred only
as a downhill energy flow, whereas the uphill process was
missing. It was somewhat surprising as the energy difference
between polaritons was close to kBT. The downhill process
could be due to favorable population transfer from UP to a
manifold of MP states, which remains to be further studied.
Nevertheless, the preferred downhill transfer should be
considered for future designs of polariton-mediated energy
transfer process.
Figure 3. Polariton-enabled intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. (A) Under normal circumstances, there is no directional VET from W(CO)6
and W(13CO)6 because it is outcompeted by energy dissipation to the solvents. (B) The absence of intermolecular VET is confirmed in the 2D IR
spectrum, as there is no cross-peak between the two species. (C) By VSC, intermolecular VET is enabled. (D) The UP is composed mostly of W(CO)6
(donor, D) and cavity modes, with little contribution from W(13CO)6 (acceptor, A). (E) In the 2D IR spectrum, when UP is excited, a clear cross-peak
appears at ω3 = ωLP (orange box), indicating that exciting UP can transfer energy to A, as shown in (F), while the cross-peak at ω3 = ωMP (black box)
reports the energy relaxation to the D channel, as shown in (G). The intensity ratio between the peaks at ω3 = ωLP and ω3 = ωMP suggests that
intermolecular VET occurred. (A−E) are adapted with permission from ref 2. Copyright 2020 the authors of ref 2, under exclusive license to the

■ VIBRATIONAL-POLARITON-MODIFIED
PSEUDOROTATION DYNAMICS
A central question in polariton chemistry research involves the
roles of polaritons and dark modes in modifying chemical
reactions. The question comes from the prediction that
polaritons can change the potential energy landscapes of
reactions and that dark modes behave like regular molecules.16
However, because of the large density of states of the dark
reservoir modes in the collective VSC regime, the observation of
modified chemistry in collective VSC implies that dark modes
must also influence chemical transformations. There are a
couple of factors contributing to the present challenge. First,
most techniques implemented for studying polariton chemistry
to date only monitor the end products without differentiating
whether the initial states were polaritons or dark modes. Second,
nearly all reactions studied were multiple-step complex
reactions,66 making it difficult to pinpoint the mechanisms.
My group addressed this challenge by focusing on a singlestep
chemical transformation, the well-characterized Berry
pseudorotation of Fe(CO)5,67 using 2D IR spectroscopy, by
which we could differentiate the polariton-initiated pseudorotation
dynamics from that initiated by dark reservoir modes.
The pseudorotation of Fe(CO)5 is an isomerization where the
axial and equatorial CO ligands exchange with each other,
making the products identical to the reactants after the
dynamics. This isomerization also leads to energy exchange
between the corresponding axial (a2″) and equatorial (e′) modes,
which is manifested as a cross-peak in the 2D IR spectrum.
However, an intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR)
channel could also be a minor pathway (Figure 4A, top). Harris,
Cahoon, and co-workers have characterized its dynamics outside
of cavities.38
When strongly coupled to the cavity modes, the a2″ and e′
modes split into three polariton states (UP, MP, and LP), with
UP composed mostly by the a2″ mode, LP by the e′ mode, and
MP as a mixture of the two. Using the cross-peaks at ω3 = ωLP,
we followed the energy exchange dynamics initiated by pumping
UP and dark a2″ modes (Figure 4B). When UP was pumped, the
energy exchange rate (kex) was 0.113 ± 0.009 ps−1, which is
higher than the counterpart of Fe(CO)5 outside of the cavity (kex
= 0.084 ± 0.002 ps−1); in contrast, when dark a2″ modes were
pumped, kex = 0.090 ± 0.006 ps−1, similar the case of outside of
the cavity. Thus, it appeared that under VSC, only polaritons
could modify the dynamics, while dark modes could not (Figure
4C).
However, the dynamics that caused the acceleration of energy
exchange deserved more attention because other channels, such
as IVR, could also lead to energy exchange between the a2″ and e′
modes and create the same cross-peaks. We differentiated IVR
and pseudorotation by their initial anisotropy (Figure 5).68
When IVR occurred, the energy exchange happened between
two normal modes perpendicular to each other, resulting in an
initial anisotropy of −0.2 (Figure 5A). When pseudorotation
occurred, the a2″ mode morphed into the e′ mode without
changing the orientation of the modes in the molecular frame,
leading energy exchange between two modes parallel to each
other. In this case, the initial anisotropy should be 0.4 (Figure
5B). The actual anisotropy when pumping UP was −0.08, and
the outside cavity case was 0.06. Thus, qualitatively, we
concluded that under VSC, it indeed promoted IVR to dominate
over pseudorotation and accelerated the overall energy
exchange. Quantitative fitting using kinetic models led to kps =
Figure 4. Polariton-modified chemical dynamics. (A) Under normal conditions, the Fe(CO)5 molecules favor pseudorotation over IVR (top), but
under VSC, polaritons accelerate IVR and slow down pseudorotation. (B) The 2D IR spectrum of polaritons (middle) is formed by strong coupling of
Fe(CO)5 with the cavity modes. The [ωUP, ωLP] (cross-peaks, labeled by a blue square) and [ωUP, ωMP] (diagonal peaks, red square) are used to follow
the energy exchange between the a2″ and e′ modes. (top) Linear IR spectrum and (bottom) spectral cut atω1 =ωUP of the system. (C) Energy exchange
dynamics and fits show that under VSC, exciting UP accelerates the energy exchange dynamics (blue), while when the dark a2″ modes are excited
(gray), the energy exchange remains similar to that outside of cavities (red). Adapted with permission from ref 3. Copyright 2022 the authors of ref 3,

0.022 ± 0.005 ps−1 and kIVR = 0.043 ± 0.002 ps−1 when UP was
excited, compared to kps = 0.035 ±0.001 ps−1 and kIVR = 0.024±
0.001 ps−1 when the molecules were outside of the cavity
(Figure 5C,D). Thus, VSC not only promoted IVR but also
decelerated pseudorotation compared to the case without VSC.
However, dark modes did not have such an effect. The
reflectivity of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) optics can
depend on the polarizations of incoming beams, which may
influence the anisotropy. In this experiment, such an effect was
small, as the anisotropy of diagonal peaks remained close to the
theoretical value of 0.4. Clearly, polaritons in VSC can promote
intramolecular or intermolecular VET. The physical origin of
suppressing pseudorotation could be loss of its driving force due
to IVR or being hindered by the excited phonons. Other driving
forces, such as excitation to hot vibrational modes,69 could also
play a role. This VSC-modified dynamics was just recently
supported by a hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical
cavity molecular dynamics scheme,70 which could
provide critical mechanistic insights in the future. The
reflectivity of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) optics can
depend on the polarizations of incoming beams, which may
influence the anisotropy. In this experiment, such an effect was
small, as the anisotropy of diagonal peaks remained close to the
theoretical value of 0.4.
This work unambiguously demonstrated that polaritons can
influence chemical transformationsthe central concept in
polariton chemistrybut also clarified that the dark modes
behave like uncoupled molecules. Thus, it added a pillar to the
polariton chemistry research and pointed out that future
enhancement of polariton chemistry could lie in miniaturizing
the cavity volume to reduce dark modes.71−73

■ TOWARD VIBRATIONAL-POLARITON-BASED
QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
While strong coupling to photons can change molecular
properties, VSC can also modify photonic properties. One
direct result is the strong optical nonlinearities of photons that
otherwise would not exist. The strong optical nonlinearity could
enable the use of photons/polaritons as quantum bits (qubits).
My group has shown that nonlinearity can be modulated by
simply controlling the cavity size. More importantly, we
observed Rabi oscillations between LP and UP (Figure
6A).51,74 The Rabi oscillation only lasted for about 5 ps, as
determined by the Q factor of the cavity. However, it indicated
that coherence between LP and UP could be prepared and act as
a qubit.
We have made a few steps to prepare vibrational polaritons as
a new quantum technology platform by showing that polaritons
can nonlinearly interact with each other when sitting in different
cavities.4,75 We used photolithography and deposition techniques
to create a checkerboard-pattern DBR, with adjacent
squares having an ∼200 nm height difference. Thus, when the
patterned DBR was paired with a flat DBR, they formed
neighboring cavities with different longitudinal thicknesses and
resonant frequencies (Figure 6B,C). Each cavity could form its
own UP and LP with W(CO)6, resulting in four polariton peaks
in the linear spectrum (Figure 6D).
Using 2D IR spectroscopy, we resolved cross-peaks indicating
that when the polaritons in cavity A were excited, the polaritons
in cavity B responded to the excitation (green shaded area in
Figure 7A). Thus, nonlinear interactions exist between polaritons
in different cavities. The existence of nonlinearity across
space arises because of the photonic cavity evanescent wave and
the large molecular nonlinearity.
We used this platform to simulate and visualize coherence
transfer between cavities.76 Coherence transfer has been
considered important in the energy relay of biological and
chemical systems.77,78 The natural spatial (nanometers) and
temporal (femtosecond) scales of coherence transfer made it
difficult to resolve simultaneously in both domains. The
checkerboard polariton platform, whose cavity lateral separation
was 50 μm, made it possible to excite coherence or population in
one cavity and watch it evolve in space and time (Figure 7B). We
spatially visualized the polariton signals by converting the 2D IR
spectrometer into a spectromicroscope that could resolve the
spectra along the horizontal dimension of the detector and the
spatial location of the signals vertically (Figure 7D). This new
instrument thus allowed the coherence dynamics to be tracked
in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains.
When the |UPA⟩⟨LPA| coherence was prepared in cavity A, it
launched Rabi oscillations in spectral peaks located at ω3 = ωUPA
or ωLPA, but quickly the oscillations also appeared in peaks at ω3
= ωUPB or ωLPB. This result indicated that coherence from cavity
A was transferred to cavity B (Figure 7C, top). The spatial−
temporal plot confirmed this conclusion. The Rabi oscillation at
ω3 = ωUPA was initially launched in cavity A and quickly
transferred to cavity B (Figure 7E). Thereby, coherences could
be transferred spatially among the vibrational polaritons on the
checkerboard cavity.
Interestingly, this transfer did not always occur. For example,
when |UPB⟩⟨LPB| coherence was prepared in cavity B, there was
no such transfer to cavity A (Figure 7C, bottom). The
unidirectional coherence transfer suggested non-Hermitian
dynamics. The reason for non-Hermitian dynamics was that at
the same in-plane momentum, the photons that drove the
coherence transfer always had higher energy when residing in
cavity A than in cavity B. Thus, it was energetically favorable for
photons from A to scatter to the state of cavity B at higher
momentum without any energy penalty (Figure 7F). However,
the same could not happen to photons at cavity B near zero inplane
momentum. When the same experiments occurred at high
momentum, the coherence transfer became allowed in both
directions (see the Supporting Information of ref 76). ■ OUTLOOK AND KEY FUTURE CHALLENGES
Polaritons, a concept from quantum electrodynamics, have great
potential to add a new paradigm to chemistry. Currently, many
results have phenomenologically demonstrated the feasibility of
this direction. It is critical to support this new phenomenon with

preparing square-shaped extrusions on the cavity optics, forming a checkerboard pattern. (C) The checkerboard pattern optic and a flat mirror can
form cavities with different resonant frequencies that spatially overlap through evanescent waves. (D) When strongly coupled with the asymmetric
mode of W(CO)6, each cavity forms its own UP and LP. The linear spectrum of the system is shown at the right. From ref 4. CC BY-NC 4.0.

a solid theoretical and mechanistic foundation. The works from
our group used ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy to follow the
vibrational energy evolution inside VSC systems in a stateresolved
manner. The results provide insights into what
polaritons can do: First, polaritons can open and promote
vibrational energy transfers, either within or between molecules;
second, polaritons can also modify the dynamics of single-step
chemical transformations; finally, inside of VSC, the dark modes
do not show clear evidence of changing chemical dynamics. The
impact of these results includes that they are unified with many
theoretical predictions and lead to rational directions to improve
polariton chemistry.
However, all of the experiments discussed here used an
external IR pulse to pump the polaritons, while other VSCmodified
experiments were carried out under thermally
activated conditions, namely, there was no external photon
input. The results of ultrafast spectroscopy here could be
connected to the thermally activated VSC reactions by
estimating the population of thermally excited polariton states.
However, it is expected that the population is too small and
insufficient to explain the thermally activated VSC reactions.
Further connections remain to be explored. Furthermore, the
detuning dependence of polariton chemistry,12 another outstanding
experimental observation, remains to be better
understood to explain why the energy match between the zero
in-plane momentum cavity mode and vibrational modes
determined the polariton chemistry; in contrast, cavity modes
at higher momentum do not seem to matter. The recently

that when polaritons in cavity A (Figure 6B) are excited, they also perturb polaritons in cavity B. (B) Schematic of the coherence transport experiment
using the checkerboard polariton platform. The shaped IR pulses prepare polariton coherences in cavity A, and the coherences then are transferred to B
and are followed by probe pulses. (C) Unidirectional coherence transfer is seen when cavity A coherences, such as |UPA⟩⟨LPA|, are transferred to cavity
B and trigger coherence oscillations of polaritons in cavity B (top). The same coherence transfer does not happen when coherences, such as |UP⟩⟨LPB|,
are prepared in cavity B (bottom). (D) 2D IR imaging setup allows resolution of the spectral peak frequency along the horizontal direction and the
spatial location of polaritons along the vertical direction. (E) Ultrafast spectral image showing that after |UPA⟩⟨LPA| is prepared in cavity A, it is indeed
transferred to polaritons in cavity B across space. (F) The unidirectional coherence transfer can be explained by the cavity dispersion curve. Cavity
mode A always has higher energy than cavity mode B at the same momentum. Thus, photons in A can scatter to cavity B with a large momentum but the
same energy and then relax to the bottom of the dispersion curve. The opposite is less favorable due to the energy penalty. (A) is from ref 4. CC BY-NC

developed zero-dispersion polariton modes in a confined
cavity79 could further provide insight into the role of the
dispersion curve in VSC-modified chemistry.
On the quantum technology side, we showed that polaritons
can interact nonlinearly across space, similar to what is
demonstrated in trapped ions or cold atoms, but under ambient
conditions. It is natural to extend the checkerboard systems into
a more sophisticated design to simulate natural systems with
energy and coherence transfers or to achieve quantum effects,
such as topological states.80 Obviously, the roadblock is
decoherence. Fortunately, the vibrational coherence oscillates
at the femtosecond time scale, which requires a much shorter
coherence lifetime to achieve the same figure of merit of existing
quantum systems. Decoherence could be alleviated by using
molecular crystals or operating at a lower temperature (above
cryogenic) where bath motions are slowed down or frozen.
Another important development would be achieving VSC using
nanocavities, which could significantly reduce the number of
molecules needed for MVP formation and amplify the quantum
features of the systems. Together with these developments, I
expect that MVP could complement existing quantum
information platforms.
Overall, molecular vibrational polaritons are an exciting field
that integrates photonics into molecular science. The
fundamental chemical physics of MVPs is critical to make this
field a potential fast lane to advance chemistry and quantum
technology.

Biography
Wei Xiong is a Full Professor and Kent Wilson Faculty Scholar in the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of
California, San Diego. He received his B.S. degree from Peking
University in China in 2006. He then joined Prof. Martin Zanni’s group
at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and completed his Ph.D.
degree in 2011. At Madison, he focused on developing novel 2D
vibrational spectroscopy methods (transient 2D IR and heterodyne 2D
SFG spectroscopy) to study molecules on solid-state material surfaces.
He then moved to the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2011, where
he worked with Prof. Margaret Murnane and Henry Kapteyn to develop
the table-top XUV source for ultrafast measurements and time-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy for nanoparticles. He joined the faculty at
the University of California, San Diego in 2014. At UCSD, his research
focuses on using and developing ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopic and
imaging tools to reveal molecular structures and dynamics of materials,
including ultrafast dynamics of polaritonic systems, guest molecule
adsorptions in self-assembled materials, and femtosecond charge
transfer dynamics on organic material interfaces.
