We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of a hydrogen interstitial in magnetic -iron,
taking account of the quantum 
uctuations of the proton as well as the anharmonicities of lattice
vibrations and hydrogen hopping. We show that the diusivity of hydrogen in the lattice of BCC
iron deviates strongly from an Arrhenius behavior at and below room temperature. We compare
a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular dynamics in the calculation
of diusivity and we nd that the role of phonons is to inhibit, not to enhance, diusivity at
intermediate temperatures in constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address
the trapping of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps in
a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are able to separate out
the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and
quantum contributions. We nd that about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to
a lattice defect in iron is accounted for by nite temperature eects and about half of these arise
from quantum proton 
uctuations. This has huge implications for the comparison between thermal
desorption and permeation experiments and standard electronic structure theory. The implications
are even greater for the interpretation of muon spin resonance experiments.
The injection, transport and trapping of subatomic
particles such as protons, deuterons, tritons, muons,
or positrons in solids takes a pivotal role in experi-
mental characterization techniques such as muon spin
spectroscopy (SR) [1], positron annihilation experi-
ments [2, 3]; and in the design of plasma containment
in fusion power generators [4]. In the case of hydrogen,
diusion and trapping is also crucial in many technolog-
ical and materials science applications, including for in-
stance hydrogen storage and fuel cells [5, 6], in particular
the deleterious eects of hydrogen on electrode integrity
as a consequence of the Gorski eect. Diusion of hy-
drogen in iron is also of interest in nal stages of stellar
evolution [7]. The problem of hydrogen embrittlement of
iron and steel is deeply concerned with the rate of proton
diusion and the depth of lattice defect traps which may
serve to attenuate the diusivity, since it is expected that
crack tip speed may be limited by the rate at which it
can be fed by hydrogen [8]. The trapping of hydrogen by
vacancies is of particular importance because by the de-
factant eect [9] the vacancy is stabilized by trapping and
indeed the equilibrium vacancy concentration is known
to be enhanced by orders of magnitude as a result of hy-
drogen ingress [10] leading to damage and compromised
structural integrity [11]. The depth of a microstructural
trap, that is, the free energy gain by transferring a proton
from a bulk tetrahedral site into the trap, is extremely
hard to measure since although an average trap depth
over many defects is accessible through thermal desorp-
tion spectroscopy, it is not possible to prepare specimens
with just a single defect in order to distinguish, say a
dislocation trap from a grain boundary or interface site.
This is particularly dicult in the case of the vacancy.
It is possible to calculate trap depths using density func-
tional theory (DFT) and for example it has been shown
that the vacancy may trap up to six protons|one close
to each face of the cube surrounding the defect [12]. Un-
fortunately standard DFT calculations have ready access
only to the zero temperature total energy the quantum
nature of the subatomic particle is usually neglected or
accounted for only in terms of a zero point energy (ZPE).
Our aim in the present work is to unravel various con-
tributions to the binding free energy to provide both a
framework for the general case and to address the trap-
ping of H in ferrite (-Fe) quantitatively. Atomistic mod-
elling of a hydrogen interstitial in -iron poses enormous
challenges; rst the magnetism requires an explicit treat-
ment of the electronic degrees of freedom of the sys-
tem [12{14], second the timescale required to measure
the H binding free energy to defects as well as the diu-
sivity in the bulk lattice is usually not accessible in ab
initio MD simulations. To make the matter even more
complex, the small mass of the proton means that nuclear
quantum eects (NQEs) can play an important role at
room temperature and below. For instance, it has been
demonstrated that NQEs have a signicant eect on the
thermodynamic stability of dierent phases [15{17], as
well as on the diusivity of protons [18{20].
In the present study interatomic forces are described
within the self consistent magnetic tight binding (TB)
approximation [21]. Parameters for the model are given
in Ref. [22]. TB theory is an abstraction of the DFT and
hence has the benet of capturing the essential physics of
the chemical bond, including self consistent charge trans-

fer, with forces derived from the Hellmann-Feynman the-
orem, but because the Hamiltonian is obtained from a
tted look-up table rather than determined ab initio, the
method is computationally very fast. The evaluation of
NQEs is achieved by using the imaginary time path in-
tegral formalism of quantum mechanics. The path inte-
gral formalism maps the quantum mechanical partition
function onto the partition function of a classical ring-
polymer system [23{26], and as such the quantum system
can be described by P copies of the physical system with
corresponding particles in adjacent replicas connected by
harmonic springs. When P = 1 the nuclei are purely clas-
sical, and when P ! 1 each nucleus in the ring polymer
system is fully consistent with the statistics of a quantum
system of distinguishable particles. Methods inspired
by path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) [27, 28]
can also be used to approximate time-dependent observ-
ables. We will use the thermostatted ring polymer molec-
ular dynamics (TRPMD) method [29]. The reader is re-
ferred to recent reviews for a more thorough discussion
of PIMD-related methods [30].
In order to compute the quantum congurational dis-
tribution and the diusivity of H in bulk -Fe lattice, we
rst performed TRPMD simulations of a system consist-
ing of 16 Fe atoms on a perfect BCC iron lattice, and
a H interstitial atom. We performed simulations at 300,
200, 150, 100 and 50 K, increasing the number of beads
P from 16 to 64 beads as the temperature was lowered,
to account for the stronger quantum nature of nuclei at
lower temperature. For the sake of comparison, we also
performed classical simulations (i.e. only using one bead
for the ring polymer) from 1000 K to 100 K. The diu-
sion coecients of H in the bulk -Fe lattice were com-
puted from the ! ! 0 limit of the velocity-velocity au-
tocorrelation spectrum of the H atom. Results for these
simulations are reported in Figure 1, compared with the
results from a previous calculation using a classical em-
bedded atom potential (EAM) for interatomic forces [31],
as well as experimental measurements [32, 33] in the high-
temperature regime.
The most prominent observation from Figure 1 is the
stark dierence between the classical and the quantum
diusion coecient of H in the bulk lattice at tempera-
tures equal or lower than room temperature. Using clas-
sical molecular dynamics, the temperature dependence
closely follows Arrhenius behavior as indicated by the
dashed red line. Furthermore, the classical diusivities
predicted by the TB hamiltonian and the EAM force
eld are very similar, despite the distinct forms of the
potentials. However, when nuclear quantum eects are
included by either using the path integral formalism or
by employing centroid molecular dynamics, a strong de-
viation of the H diusivity from Arrhenius behavior be-
low room temperature emerges. At the low-T end of the
experimental temperature range (300 K), classical MD
predictions for both TB and EAM are about a factor of

two lower than experiments, while quantum results for
both models are in good agreement. The discrepancy
between classical and quantum dynamics indicates the
importance of NQEs, which becomes dramatic at lower
temperatures (50 K to 200 K).
While the EAM and TB are in agreement in the clas-
sical MD, there is a large discrepancy at low T between
the EAM-CMD and the TB-RPMD. It is not unusual
to see larger discrepancies between potential energy sur-
faces when simulations are performed that include nu-
clear quantum 
uctuations, because congurations ex-
plore regions that display large levels of anharmonicities,
and that are often not included in the tting of the po-
tential [36, 37]. It is possible that while the EAM is
tted to the classical activation barrier, the EAM does
not describe well the three dimensional potential energy
surface for H moving around the Fe-lattice. On the other
hand the TB very well reproduces this \adiabatic sur-
face" in comparison to density functional calculations,
patricularly near the saddle point [38]. This means that
as the beads wander far from the classical reaction co-
ordinate the proton samples regions of the conguration
space that the EAM does not describe well.
It is very instructive to compare the QTST with the
TRPMD. The QTST uses xed potential energy surfaces
3
at the reactant basin and at the saddle point. After that
the partition functions are calculated, which means that
the rate coecient can be found without great eort at
any temperature [35]. Because the rather articial con-
struction is made in Ref. 35 that the potential energy in
conguration space is calculated using a relaxed atomic
system with the proton constrained at the saddle point
the QTST would be expected to overestimate the diu-
sivity. On the other hand, the QTST neglects dynamic
phonon eects such as phonon assisted tunneling in the
polaron picture [39]. From that point of view one might
expect that the TB-RPMD would predict a greater diu-
sivity than the TB-QTST. As seen in gure 1 the opposite
is the case at temperatures between 100 and 300 K. This
implies that phonon assisted tunneling is not a large ef-
fect: on the contrary our calculations reveal that phonons
attenuate proton diusion, presumably through proton-
phonon scattering. The qualitative agreement between
TB-QTST and TB-RPMD at all temperatures validates
the use of the much cheaper QTST to estimate rate co-
ecients in the quantum regime.
To elucidate the mechanism of H diusion in -Fe we
show the quantum mechanical density distribution of H
at 300 K in a BCC unit cell on the inset of Figure 1. It can
be seen that the equilibrium positions for H in the lattice
are tetrahedral (T) sites. Meanwhile, NQEs broaden the
spread of the distribution of H around the energy minima,
which indicates strong ZPE eects in the H hopping. In
other words, NQEs delocalize H in the reactant state, and
eectively reduce the free energy barrier for H migration
between neighboring T-sites.
Diusion in the perfect BCC lattice is a necessary com-
ponent of the mechanistic understanding of the mobility
of H in -Fe. However, the rate-limiting step for macro-
scopic diusion always involves binding to crystal defects.
In order to assess the importance of dierent terms in the
overall binding free energy between the H atom and the
defect, in the second part of our study we consider the
archetypical example of a vacancy in -Fe. Computing
this binding energy by sampling of the NVT ensemble is
dicult, as the waiting time for a trapped H to be re-
leased is far beyond the time scale of standard molecular
dynamics. Furthermore, a very large simulation would
be needed to bring the H atom suciently far from the
vacancy to estimate accurately the binding energy in the
dilute limit.
For these reasons, we decided to compute the stabil-
ity of a H atom bound to a vacancy, relative to that
of a H atom in a tetrahedral site of the perfect BCC
lattice, by computing rst the absolute Helmholtz free
energies for four systems separately [40]: (i ) a perfect
bulk -Fe system that has 16 atoms (Fe16), (ii ) a sys-
tem with a vacancy (Fe15), (iii ) a system with a H
interstitial (Fe16H), and (iv) a system with a vacancy
and a H interstitial (Fe15H). Based on the Helmholtz
free energy of the four independent systems, at a cer-

(TI) routes used in the free energy evaluations. The green

tain thermodynamic condition the binding energy of a
H to a mono-vacancy can be schematically expressed as
AV 􀀀H = A(Fe16H) + A(Fe15) 􀀀 A(Fe15H) 􀀀 A(Fe16).
To compute A for the four systems, we used the ther-
modynamic integration (TI) method, that uses a series
of simulations of real or articial systems to compute the
various components of the free energy dierence between
a harmonic reference system and the fully anharmonic,
quantum system. To do so eciently, we have carefully
selected a combination of multiple thermodynamic in-
tegration routes as depicted schematically in Figure 2.
This combination thus takes into account vibrational en-
tropy, anharmonicity and NQEs, and makes it possible to
disentangle the dierent contributions. Since a detailed
description of thermodynamic integration routes and sev-
eral tricks of the trade can be found in Ref. [41], here we
brie
y describe the routes employed in the present study.
The rst TI route (the green arrow in Figure 2) goes from
the classical harmonic crystal whose free energy Ah is an-
alytic, to the classical physical system at a low tempera-
ture T0 =10 K, under which condition the H interstitial
atom does not jump between degenerate trap sites about
the vacancy during the MD simulations. The second TI
route (the red arrow) allows us to obtain the temperature
dependence of the Helmholtz free energies of each Fe-H
system, by running simulations of the classical physical
system under the NVT ensemble from the low temper-
ature T0 to a higher temperature T1 = 300 K. The last
part of TI takes into account NQEs at T1 = 300 K. The
quantum mechanical free energy dierence is a function
of atomic mass, thus for a given system the overall NQEs
in free energy can be evaluated from the integration of
the quantum centroid virial kinetic energy with respect
to the ctitious atomic mass  [17, 42]. In practice, the

integrand was evaluated for the actual system and for
systems with all the atomic masses scaled 4 and 16 times
in PIMD simulations.
In Figure 3 we plot the predictions from the har-
monic approximations, the classical anharmonic free en-
ergy contribution, and the overall free energy of binding
taking into account fully both anharmonicity and NQEs.
At all temperatures, the vibrational entropy plays an im-
portant role in the hydrogen-vacancy binding energy of
the classical Fe-H systems, as demonstrated by the con-
siderable dierence between the 0 K prediction (the black
line in Figure 3) and classical harmonic approximation
(the blue line in Figure 3). This dierence in the vi-
bration frequencies of the vacancy-trapped and the free
H in the T sites also translates to the large zero point
energy contribution to the overall binding free energy,
which is indicated by the remarkable gap between the
harmonic approximations using the classical Boltzmann
distribution and the quantum mechanical Bose-Einstein
distribution (the blue line and the green line in Figure 3,
respectively). Finally, anharmonicity, which is an oft-
neglected part in previous DFT calculations [12, 13, 43{
46] has a non-negligible eect even at room temperature.
The anharmonic part of the potential is also softer for the
H in the vacancy than for the interstitial site, and so the
anharmonic contribution to the free energy leads to a fur-
ther stabilization of the bound state, both classically and
quantum mechanically. In short, the anharmonic quan-
tum mechanical trapping energy of H in alpha-iron at 300
K is predicted to be 0:3650:005 eV using the TB Hamil-
tonian. This result compared well with the experimental
measurements of 0:55 􀀀 0:81 eV for hydrogen trapping
energy in alpha-iron [47, 48], and 0:48􀀀0:63 eV for deu-
terium at room temperature [49, 50], whereas a result
based purely on the potential energy dierence between
the two states would predict a much lower binding energy
of 0.25 eV. This has implications for the identication of
trap sites by comparison of thermal desorption spectra
and total energy calculations. Figure 3 shows that the
usual correction of adding the ZPE [13] is in this case ac-
curate since the temperature correction to the harmonic
approximation at 300 K is canceled by the anharmonic
correction|but this will not always be the case.
In conclusion, we have characterized the importance
of NQEs and anharmonicity in two of the microscopic
mechanisms that underlie the transport of H atoms in
in -Fe namely H diusion in the perfect BCC lattice,
and the thermodynamic free energy that describes the
binding of H to a monovacancy. Nuclear quantum ef-
fects change the diusion coecient of H in bulk -Fe
by a factor of two at room temperature, and the quan-
tum eects become overwhelming at lower temperatures.
We then consider the case of the binding free energy of
H to a monovacancy, for which we considered and dis-
entangled dierent contributions such as vibrational en-
tropy, anharmonicity and NQEs, concluding that they all
play a signicant role at room temperature, and collec-
tively increase the binding energy from 0.25 meV to 0.36
meV. This latter is closer to the experimental estimates,
and the magnitude of the quantum contribution is con-
sistent with the experimental observation that deuterium
is less strongly bound than 1H. Our ndings thus suggest
that nuclear quantum eects may have signicant eects
on the interactions between H atoms and other defects,
which are essential in achieving a quantitative predictive
capability of the hydrogen embrittlement process. In ad-
dition, hopping and trapping of other charged subatomic
particles in metal lattices is of central importance in solid
state physics, encompassing phenomena such as SR and
positron annihilation experiments. There is no doubt in
view of our ndings that quantum 
uctuations will take
a greater part in the physics of these processes and this
study has furnished us with a recipe for how to address
these questions, such as the diusivity of a positron in a
metal or semiconductor or the trap depth of a muon at
a crystal defect.

[40] In our experience, while surprising, a 16-atom unit cell
is fully adequate for capturing the diusion and trapping
of H in -Fe. This is evidenced by our quantitative
agreement in the diusivity both from experiment and
in comparison with published EAM ndings which have
the same activation energy and which use much larger
supercells [31]. The ability to use the small unit cell is a
considerable benet since the number of force evaluations
required for determining the diusion coecient and the
trapping energy of H in the Fe systems is on the order of
107, which is beyond the capability of ab initio molecular
dynamics.
